# ðŸŽ¯ Capstone Project: Real-Time Dynamic Parking Price Optimization

> Dynamic pricing engine for urban parking lots using real-time data streaming, demand drivers & competitive pricing â€” built with Python (Pandas) and Pathway applications. Includes real-time Data Visualization using Bokeh plots and Panel.

## ðŸ“Œ **Tech Stack**
| Layer | Tools / Libraries |
|-----:|------------------:|
| Streaming data processing | [Pathway](https://pathway.com/) |
| Data manipulation | pandas, numpy |
| Visualization | Bokeh, Panel |
| Notebook & orchestration | Google Colab / Jupyter |
| Storage (CSV simulation) | pandas, local CSV files |

## ðŸ“Š **Architecture Overview**

**Goal:**  
- Ingest real-time parking data stream
- Compute demand dynamically based on occupancy, queue, traffic, special days & vehicle types
- Compute **real competitor price** using *latitude & longitude*
- Adjust price competitively
- Visualize daily price trend live
